## Lyrics

```
I wanna feel
warm ribbons dancing
on our eye lids.

I wanna feel
warm ribbons dancing
on our eye lids.

I wanna see
a place so green.
All the colors
in between
porcelain.

I wanna hear
raindrops filter down
through the leaves.
Dripping from train tracks
that became our canopy.

I wanna see
a place so green.
All the colors
in between
porcelain.
```
